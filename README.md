## Quickstart Setup
```bash
# 1) Setup
git clone https://github.com/codemedium/codemedium-editor
cd codemedium-editor
npm install

# 2a) Web based mode (native browser events)
npm start

# 2b) Desktop mode (native desktop events)
npm run desktop

# 3) Point your browser to http://localhost:8080
```

> ### Troubleshooting
> ---
> **üêû Windows** - If you run into errors after `npm install` it's probably due to Robot.js dependencies (most likely you need Python and node-gyp). If you don't need desktop mode then remove the line in `package.json` for `"robotjs"` and try running `npm install` again. If you do want desktop mode, then [check out this README](https://github.com/MIDIBlocks/handsfree-desktop) for a troubleshooting guide.
> 
> This will be fixed soon!

# About

**CodeMedium is a visual, all-in-one gesture mapping and handsfree desktop automation platform designed to help you use devices handsfree!** Some use cases include:

- [Playing commercial video games handsfree with face gestures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgVIZx-jkXA)

- [Controlling robots handsfree with head movements](https://youtu.be/lb-Bkejm0Pg?t=54)

- [Handsfree and voice-free typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0i_AivvsQ4)

- [Using a mobile device as a handsfree secondary display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNqIkVRzWbs)

CodeMedium is centered around blocks of code that are literally represented visually by blocks. CodeMedium is broken up into several views:

- [The Studio](#the-studio) is where you actually snap the blocks together to map gestures to things. All of the blocks in a Studio workspace are collectively referred to as `codeblocks`

- Each individual block represents JavaScript code and [The Factory](#the-factory) is where you design the shape of these blocks and write its code

- [The Library](#the-library) is where your Factory Blocks and Studio Codeblocks are stored. You can edit, remix, and delete them there

# Setup
## Prereqs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS LTS (eg 12.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installing
- Open terminal and clone this repository with: `git clone https://github.com/codemedium/codemedium-editor`
- Change into directory with: `cd codemedium`
- Run `npm install` from the project root to install dependencies (> 250Mb)
- Run `npm start` from the project's root to start the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not). [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting), [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/), Github, and others provide free hosting.

# Dev


## Command line scripts
```bash
# DEVELOPMENT 
# -----------
# Start the app in development mode with localStorage
npm start

# HANDSFREE DESKTOP 
# -----------
# Same as `npm start` but it controls the desktop pointer instead of a virtual one
# Adds a "Desktop Mode" toggle
npm run desktop

# PRODUCTION
# ----------
# Build the app for production with localStorage
npm run build

# DEPLOY
# ----------
# Push the app to firebase. Must have:
# - Firebase Tools: npm i -g firebase-tools
# - Initialized with: firebase init
npm run deploy
```

## `window.app`
The following is available through your browser's dev console:

```js
window.app = {
  $,        // Main Vue instance
  $studio,  // The Studio component (only present when on that route)
  $factory  // The Factory component (only present when on that route)
}
```

> üöß More info coming soon

## localStorage
The following is available inside `localStorage`:

```js
{
  blocks: [],           // All loaded Factory Blocks
  codeblocks: [],       // All loaded Studio codeblocks
  currentFactory: {},   // The Factory's last state (autosave)
  currentStudio: {},    // The Studio's last state (autosave)
  splitter: 50
}
```
